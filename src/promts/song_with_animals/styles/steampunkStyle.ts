  // Детальное описание стиля животных
  characterStyle: "Steampunk animals with soft plush fabric body material showing visible seams and light wear (vintage look). Metallic inserts: bronze, copper, brass, aged gold, sometimes chromed screws. Eyes: completely replace traditional eyes with glowing light bulbs or steampunk goggles - no white eyeballs, just the light source itself (round light bulbs, glass lenses, or steampunk goggles that emit bright light in yellow, amber, or turquoise). The entire eye area should be a glowing light element, not an eye with a glowing pupil. Mechanical elements: small gears on joints, exposed springs on paws, small steam valves on shoulders or back (emitting thin wisps of steam), pressure gauges and dial indicators built into the body, decorative rivets. Clothing details: miniature steampunk top hat or goggles on head, leather straps with buckles, pocket watch or mechanism key around neck. Form: cute, slightly round, 'huggable', but with a touch of mystery",
