  description: "Family-friendly spooky Frankenstein-inspired 3D cartoon style",

  characterStyle: "Characters are slightly humanoid Halloween creatures, reimagined as cartoon Frankenstein dolls. Bodies are rounded and plush-like, with clear large stitches holding parts together (head, arms, legs, torso). Patches of mismatched fabric are sewn on like scars. Eyes: glowing orbs without pupils, bright and expressive. Mouths: crooked smiles with stitches or missing teeth. Characters should be expressive, like animated toys in a Halloween world.",

  environmentStyle: "Spooky but fun Halloween backdrops in 3D: glowing pumpkins, crooked trees, haunted houses with warm lights, full moon and light fog. Atmosphere is playful, not scary — closer to a family Halloween special. Add cartoon bats, flickering lanterns, or smiling jack-o’-lanterns for extra charm.",

  colorPalette: "Primary colors: muted greens, bluish greys, soft blacks. Accent colors: glowing yellow-white (eyes), pumpkin orange, neon purple. Backgrounds: midnight blue, foggy teal, violet. Strong contrast between muted bodies and glowing details.",

  renderStyle: "High-quality 3D animation, Pixar-like smooth surfaces with Tim Burton/Coraline atmosphere. Rounded proportions (big head, short limbs) with clear fabric seams, stitches, and patches. Glowing eyes as the main light source. Soft dramatic lighting with moonlight + pumpkin glow. Movements slightly puppet-like but bouncy and playful."
